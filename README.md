## VBB Now

VBB Now is an OSX Yosemite Today widget that displays current nearby transit arrivals. It has been inspired by Sam Vermette's awesome Transit App.

It's not entirly done, so do not blame me if you don't catch the bus :-)

## Todo
- State handling (No Data, No Internet Connection etc.)
- Reverse Geocoding as an title
- probably an UI for the main application that ships the widget
